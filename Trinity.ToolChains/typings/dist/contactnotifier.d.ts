/**
 * This plugin handles connectivity and base exchanges with remote contacts, using DID and Carrier.
 * It runs a carrier instance (one per DID session) that can receive contact invitation requests, accept them,
 * resolve contact carrier address, send notifications to contact, etc.
 * 
 * This plugin does not manage contacts profiles and other higher level features. It must be seen as a convenience
 * native communication channel with remote peers/contacts.
 * 
 * This plugin is also not meant to enable chat capabilities between contacts. The more they can do here is to share
 * notifications, and those notifications rely on third party capsules/apps.
 * 
 * This plugin also does the following things in background:
 * 
 * Handle received contact invitations: 
 *      Received invitations are stored in a database and trigger local notifications such as "CONTACT is inviting you".
 *      Clicking such notification is normally handled by the launcher app, in order to accept the invitation.
 * 
 * Handle confirmed invitation:
 *      After a contact accepted an invitation request, this plugin gets the acknowledgment and displays a local
 *      notification such as "CONTACT has accepted your invitation"
 * 
 * Listen to incoming notifications:
 *      Listens to incoming remote notifications, and displays a local notification.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * Usage:
 * <br>
 * declare let contactNotifier: ContactNotifierPlugin.ContactNotifier;
