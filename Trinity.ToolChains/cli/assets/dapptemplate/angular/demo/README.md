# About

This elastOS browser dApp template is for elastOS developers to easily create a temporary app that contains useful sample code such as signing-in with DID, uploading a picture, starting a carrier instance, etc.

It also has reference on existing demo apps in case sample codes are not enough, as those demo apps (DID demo, carrier demo, etc) contain more complex UI flows.
